    "title": "Iran crisis live: UN says ‘cycle of horrific violence’ in Iran must end as Germany warns regime is in its ‘final weeks’",
    "content": "Spain has summoned Iran’s ambassador to Madrid to express “strong repudiation and condemnation” of the deadly crackdown on protests that has reportedly killed nearly 650 people, the foreign minister said. “The right of Iranian men and women to peaceful protest, their freedom of expression, must be respected” and “arbitrary arrests must cease”, Jose Manuel Albares told Catalunya Radio. Finland’s foreign minister, Elina Valtonen, meanwhile, said she would summon Iran’s ambassador. In a post on X, she said: Iran’s regime has shut down the internet to be able to kill and oppress in silence. This will not be tolerated. We stand with the people of Iran – women and men alike. I will summon the Iranian ambassador this morning. Together with the EU, Finland is exploring measures to help restore freedom to the Iranian people. Non-essential French embassy staff have left Iran, two sources with knowledge of the matter told Agence France-Presse. The personnel left on Sunday and Monday, the sources added, without saying how many people had departed. “The protection of our personnel and our citizens is a priority,” a French foreign ministry official told AFP. Commenting on the protests, the UN high commissioner for human rights Volker Türk said: This cycle of horrific violence cannot continue. The Iranian people and their demands for fairness, equality and justice must be heard. “The killing of peaceful demonstrators must stop, and the labelling of protesters as ‘terrorists’ to justify violence against them is unacceptable,” Türk said. It also was “extremely worrying” to hear some public statements from judicial officials mentioning the prospect of the use of the death penalty against protesters through expedited judicial proceedings, Türk added. Asked to comment on the scale of the death toll, the UN rights office spokesperson Jeremy Laurence drew on information given by the UN’s sources in Iran and told reporters: “The number that we’re hearing is hundreds.” About 2,000 people, including security personnel, have been killed in the protests in Iran, an Iranian official has told the Reuters news agency. We have not been able to independently verify this figure yet. It is difficult to do so because of the ongoing internet blackout in Iran. The official did not give a breakdown of who had been killed to Reuters. Australia’s foreign minister Penny Wong has urged her country’s nationals in Iran to leave “now” as tensions remain high between Washington and Tehran as the US reportedly weighs a series of potential military options in Iran. In a post to X, Wong said: Australia stands with the brave people of Iran in their struggle against an oppressive regime. We unequivocally condemn the Iranian regime’s brutal crackdown on its own people – the killing of protesters, the use of force, and arbitrary arrests must stop. Our ability to provide services in Iran is extremely limited. I urge any Australians still in Iran to leave now while commercial options are available. Australians in need should call the Consular Emergency Centre on 1300 555 135 (within Australia) or +61 2 6261 3305 (overseas). The protests, which began in Tehran on 28 December, were triggered by the collapse of the Iranian currency – the rial - and soon morphed into nationwide anti-regime demonstrations with people also angry at social and political restrictions imposed by the government. As my colleague William Christou notes in this story, the currency has continued to depreciate, while the government announced the end of a subsidised exchange rate for importers – a move that caused the price of groceries to soar. In September, widespread UN sanctions against Iran came back into effect for the first time in a decade after being triggered by the UK, France and Germany (the ‘E3’) as Tehran failed to convince western powers it would address their concerns over its nuclear programme. They were are a “snapback” of measures frozen in 2015 when Iran agreed to major restrictions on its nuclear programme under a deal negotiated by the former US president Barack Obama. Iran was already under huge economic strain caused by US sanctions that cut the country off from global finance. International sanctions have played a major role in worsening economic conditions for ordinary Iranians who are having to contend with high inflation, soaring prices and a huge devaluation of the rial. Iran’s economic crisis worsened again after Israel and the US launched strikes last June in a 12-day war that targeted several of the country’s nuclear sites. The US virtual embassy in Iran has urged for US citizens to get out of the country “now” (if possible) and to have a plan for leaving that does not “rely” on US government help. In a security alert published on Tuesday, the embassy said: Protests across Iran are escalating and may turn violent, resulting in arrests and injuries. Increased security measures, road closures, public transportation disruptions, and internet blockages are ongoing. The government of Iran has restricted access to mobile, landline, and national internet networks. Airlines continue to limit or cancel flights to and from Iran, with several suspending service until Friday, January 16. It recommends for US citizens to avoid demonstrations, “keep a low profile” and, if it is safe to do so, consider leaving Iran “by land” to Armenia or Turkey. If leaving is impossible, the virtual embassy said people should find a “secure location” within their residence or another safe building, and keep a supply of essential items including food, water and medication. As of yesterday, protests were reported to have taken place in at least 186 cities across all 31 provinces in Iran. Iran’s internet shutdown has passed the 108-hour mark, according to an update from the internet tracking agency NetBlocks posted about four hours ago. The tracking agency has said the blackout, which has seriously hampered the media’s ability to report on what is going on inside of Iran, could be circumvented with shortwave radio, connecting to cell coverage at borders, Starlink and satellite phones. For the first time in days Iranian authorities allowed members of the public to make phone calls abroad, the Associated Press reported this morning. But there are still restrictions on the internet and texting services have reportedly not been restored. More than 90 million people have been cut off from the internet since the demonstrations in Iran began, according to the human rights organisation Witness. As we mentioned in the opening post, Donald Trump said in a Truth Social post on Monday that countries doing business with Iran would be hit with a 25% tariff on trade with the US, a move that is likely to impact major economies like China and India. You can keep up to date with the latest market reaction and how the price of oil has been impacted by the announcement in our business live blog. We are restarting our live coverage of the ongoing anti-government protests in Iran which are widely seen as the most serious challenge to the country’s Islamic Republic in recent years. At least 648 protesters have been killed in the ongoing crackdown, according to the Norway-based NGO Iran Human Rights. Thousands more people have been injured since the demonstrations started on 28 December over the collapse of the Iranian currency and general economic malaise. Speaking while on a diplomatic visit to India earlier today, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said he believes the Iranian government is in its “final days and weeks”, adding that the regime lacks “legitimacy through elections in the population”. “If a regime can only keep itself in power by force, then it’s effectively at the end,” Merz said. The Iranian regime has been condemned by many world leaders for its harsh crackdown including mass arrests, internet blackouts and public warnings that participation in the demonstrations could carry the death penalty. On Tuesday morning, the Associated Press reported mobile phones in Iran were able to make international calls, although restrictions on the internet reportedly remain in place. Meanwhile, the US president, Donald Trump, has said any country that does business with Iran will face a tariff rate of 25% on trade with the US. The White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, told reporters on Monday that airstrikes were among the “many, many options” that Trump was considering but that “diplomacy is always the first option for the president”. Trump’s national security team is expected to meet later to discuss options. Stick with us as we bring you the latest lines.",

    "title": "Mané v Salah: veteran superstars dominate buildup to Senegal v Egypt Afcon semi",
    "content": "The Olembe Stadium, Yaoundé, 6 February 2022, the Africa Cup of Nations final. Senegal and Egypt drew 0-0. Penalties. The first three kicks were scored, then Egypt’s Mohamed Abdelmonem hit the post. Mohamed Abou Gabal immediately saved from Bouna Sarr but Eduard Mendy saved the fourth Egyptian effort, from Mohanad Lasheen. After four penalties each, Senegal led 3-2; Sadio Mané had the chance to win it. Mané had missed a fifth-minute penalty in the game. He’d missed a penalty against Cameroon in the shootout after the quarter-final in Franceville in 2017. “I can’t explain how tough it was for me,” Mané said. “I was sleeping four or five hours a night, five hours maximum. I had a big pressure in my head. I would go to bed and wake up maybe at 4am and I could not sleep any more … Everybody knew I was obsessed about this tournament and wanted to win it with my country … Thinking about this penalty I can say it was one of the hardest things in my life.” But he steeled himself, using the meditation techniques he’d recently started practising, took a long angled run, and drilled his kick low to Gabal’s right, just inside the post. Senegal had won Afcon for the first time. On the halfway line, meanwhile, Mohamed Salah pulled the hem of his shirt over his head, covering his face. The game was lost before he’d even had the chance to take his kick. The Stade Abdoulaye Wade, Dakar, 29 March 2022, CAF World Cup qualifying playoff second leg. A fourth-minute Hamdy Fathy own-goal gave Senegal a 1-0 win, meaning the tie finished 1-1 on aggregate. Penalties. Salah wasn’t going to make the same mistake again and wait to take the fifth kick. After Kalidou Koulibaly had missed Senegal’s opening effort, the forward, the green light of laser pens flickering across his face, blasted over. The outcome was the same as it had been seven weeks earlier: Mané scored the winning kick and prevailed over his Liverpool teammate. Senegal and Egypt, Mané and Salah, will face off again in the semi-final of the latest edition of Afcon. Those two meetings four years ago understandably dominate the buildup but Mané and Salah also both played in Senegal’s two Africa Cup of Nations qualifying wins over Egypt in 2014. Five games played between the two, Salah has been on the winning side only once: the first leg of a two-legged World Cup qualifying playoff that was ultimately lost. That’s probably the major reason it seems he has a point to make in Tangier on Wednesday. Mané and Salah are both 33, born 66 days apart on opposite sides of the continent. Mané, the elder, is the son of an imam from Bambali, on the north bank of the Casamance. His family didn’t want him to be a footballer so he ran away from home aged 15, taking the bus to Dakar. Salah was born in Nagrig, just east of the Nile. His family were less wary of football, but having made a bus journey of three-to-four hours to training with the Cairo club Al Mowkaloon and back every day, he too ended up, aged 15, leaving home to live in his country’s capital. Their careers have run along not dissimilar lines. Both, for instance, have funded significant infrastructure projects in their home countries. But the sense at Liverpool was that their relationship was always a little spiky. “They were never best friends; each kept himself to himself,” Roberto Firmino said. “It was rare to see the two of them talking and I’m not sure if that had to do with the Egypt-Senegal rivalry in African competitions.” That reserve erupted into something more in August 2019 during a 3-0 win at Burnley in which Mané felt Salah had repeatedly not passed to him when he felt he was in the better position. Both have insisted that their occasional flare-ups were essentially trivial, born of a mutual desire to win. “I told him,” Mané said the following day, “‘Don’t worry. It’s over. I was angry because I think you can make better passes with your talent.’” “I don’t think it [their flare-ups] affected the team,” Salah told France Football last year. “It’s human to want more, I understand that, he’s a competitor. Off the pitch we weren’t very close, but we always respected each other.” The two enjoyed great success together, winning a Premier League title and a Champions League, but their shared history clearly adds a frisson, particularly given memories of 2022 and the possibility that this could be the final time they ever play against each other (although there is a possibility they meet in the Saudi Pro League next season). Salah has four goals in this Cup of Nations but has adorned games rather than controlled them. Mané has just one and is not as explosive as he once was, but the intelligence of his passing remains. They are fading giants, but they are still giants. Senegal v Egypt is not just Mané v Salah, but that framing is unavoidable. And in Tangier, Salah has the chance to assuage some of the hurt of those penalties in Yaoundé and Dakar four years ago.",

    "title": "Denmark says US vice-president JD Vance to join talks on Greenland – Europe live",
    "content": "Nordic correspondent in Nuuk, Greenland In Nuuk, Pele Broberg, leader of opposition party Naleraq, which came second in last year’s election, said the preferable outcome is to reach a deal with the US. “They want to do a deal the easy way or the hard way: who wants the hard way? I don’t understand why that’s a subject. If there is a deal to be made great, but we haven’t heard about it, we have no clue what he is talking about. So that will be interesting after Wednesday.” Broberg criticised the Greenlandic government’s decision to release a statement on Monday in which it said it would increase its efforts to ensure its defence took place “in the Nato framework” so soon before Wednesday’s meeting. “I don’t know why they don’t just wait until that to see what is up and down with this,” he told the Guardian. He also questioned the inclusion of the Danish foreign minister. “It’s a little bit strange that it is not a meeting between the US and Greenlandic foreign ministers, but that the Danish foreign minister is in on that meeting. The reason why it doesn’t make sense for me is it has nothing to do with Danish foreign politics and everything to do with the Greenlandic peoples’ future.” He accused Copenhagen of “using Nato and the Danish ownership of Greenland” to have a say in Greenland’s future. “It shows they are still not ready to actually let us go.” He called on the governments to be open about what is said in the meeting to stop speculation. “I hope they have a meeting where they go out with a press conference afterwards and say ‘this has been talked about’. ‘Offers of free association or not’, ‘offers of annexation or not’ or whatever they talked about.” And in what is a rather curious coincidence, the Danish government has just announced that it will host the biannual talks and the meeting of the foreign, security and defence policy contact committee with the Faroese and the Greenlandic governments, erm, tomorrow. The meeting will be attended by Greenland’s prime minister, Jens Frederik-Nielsen, alongside, obviously, the Danish prime minister, Mette Frederiksen. “The three countries will have the opportunity to discuss the political and economic situation,” the government’s statement said. The meeting will be effectively taking place in parallel to the US talks with JD Vance and Rubio. US vice-president JD Vance will join tomorrow’s meeting between Danish and Greenlandic foreign ministers and US state secretary Marco Rubio, Danish foreign minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen told reporters. Speaking after a meeting of the Danish parliament’s foreign affairs committee, he said that JD Vance wanted to participate in the talks and will host them at the White House. Rasmussen said that Denmark and Greenland requested the meeting to discuss in person the latest on Greenland after increasingly assertive comments from US officials, including US president Donald Trump, about their ambition to control the territory. Defence minister Troels Lund Poulsen added that he would also meeting with the Nato secretary general Mark Rutte on Monday to discuss “issues regarding security in and around the Arctic,” and he will also be joined by Greenland’s foreign minister Vivian Motzfeldt. Meanwhile, a number of airports in central and eastern Europe faced delays and disruptions due to difficult weather conditions this morning. Budapest airport was temporarily closed as a precaution due to black ice and extreme icing, the airport said on Facebook. Airports in Bratislava, Prague, and Vienna were also affected, Reuters added. According to FlightRadar24’s disruption meter, Vienna has seen most disruption, with delays up to two hours of both arrivals and departures. The EU has warned Elon Musk’s X to urgently “fix” the “horrendous” AI tool allowing users to “undress” women and children or face urgent acton. The blunt warning comes as the European Commission has extended a retention order sent to Elon Musk’s X last year to retain and preserve all internal documents and data related to Grok until the end of 2026, amid a global outcry over Grok-generated “undressed” images. “X now has to fix its AI tool in the EU, and they have to do it quickly. If not, we will not hesitate to put the DSA to its full use to protect EU citizens,” the EU tech commissioner Henna Virkunnen said last night. “X offering the use of Grok to create and share pictures of undressed women and children is horrendous,” she added in a post on X. Governments and regulators from Europe to Asia are cracking down on sexually explicit content generated by Elon Musk’s xAI chatbot Grok on X, launching probes, imposing bans and demanding safeguards, in a growing global push to curb illegal material. Separately, Malaysia’s communications regulator said on Tuesday it will take legal action against social media platform X due to concerns over user safety in relation to artificial intelligence feature Grok Meanwhile, the foreign affairs committee of the Danish parliament is scheduled to meet this morning to discuss the latest on Greenland as the US president, Donald Trump, shows no signs of losing interest in the territory. Foreign minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen and defence minister Troels Lund Poulsen will represent the government, as it consults on the issue ahead of tomorrow’s high-stake meeting with US state secretary Marco Rubio. Meanwhile, a number of protests against the US policy are expected to be held later this week across Denmark, according to DR. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that Russia hit Ukraine overnight with “almost 300 attack drones” and 25 missiles as it continues to target energy infrastructure across the country, already suffering from extensive electricity and heat outages amid a harsh winter. Zelenskyy said the overnight attacks caused “extensive destruction of residential and civilian infrastructure” across the country, including in the capital Kyiv, Dnipro, Kharkiv and Donetsk. Zelenskyy said that “several hundred thousand households” in the Kyiv region remain without power, and the situation “is not easy,” with temperatures as low as -12 Celsius this morning. “As always, wherever Russia tries to destroy, Ukrainians support one another, and internal resilience is what is most needed right now,” he said. Zelenskyy also added that “with no military purpose whatsoever, Russia lobbed missiles at a postal terminal in Korotych, Kharkiv region, killing 4 people.” He said: “Every such strike against life is a reminder that support for Ukraine cannot be stopped. Missiles for air defense systems are needed every day, and especially during winter. The world can respond to this Russian terror with new assistance packages for Ukraine. We expect the acceleration of deliveries already agreed with America and Europe. Russia must come to learn that cold will not help it win the war. Thank you to everyone who is helping.",

    "title": "Donald Trump says ‘we’re screwed’ if supreme court rejects global trade tariffs – US politics live",
    "content": "Vice-president JD Vance and secretary of state Marco Rubio will meet the foreign ministers of Denmark and Greenland on Wednesday, the Danish foreign minister said on Tuesday, amid Trump’s push to take control of the Arctic island. Danish foreign minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen and his Greenlandic counterpart Vivian Motzfeldt had requested the meeting after Trump last week stepped up threats to take over Greenland, an autonomous territory under the Kingdom of Denmark. Trump first floated the idea of the US taking over Greenland in 2019 during his first term in office and ramped up pressure last week after his administration kidnapped and removed the Venezuelan leader Nicholas Maduro. Eleven of the world’s top central bankers have released a statement of support for Fed chair Jerome Powell, after the US Department of Justice opened a criminal investigation into him which he argued was politically driven. In an unprecedented move, top central bank chiefs including the Bank of England’s Andrew Bailey, and Christine Lagarde of the European Central Bank, have backed Powell, and warned against undermining central bank independence. The heads of the Swedish, Denmark, Swiss, Australian, Canadian, South Korean, and Brazilian central banks have also signed, as have two top officials at the Bank of International Settlements (known as the “central bank for central banks”). Others may yet sign the letter. The bank chiefs say: We stand in full solidarity with the Federal Reserve System and its Chair Jerome H. Powell. The independence of central banks is a cornerstone of price, financial and economic stability in the interest of the citizens that we serve. It is therefore critical to preserve that independence, with full respect for the rule of law and democratic accountability. Chair Powell has served with integrity, focused on his mandate and an unwavering commitment to the public interest. To us, he is a respected colleague who is held in the highest regard by all who have worked with him. The letter is signed by: Christine Lagarde, President of the European Central Bank on behalf of the ECB Governing Council Andrew Bailey, Governor of the Bank of England Erik Thedéen, Governor of Sveriges Riksbank Christian Kettel Thomsen, Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Danmarks Nationalbank Martin Schlegel, Chairman of the Governing Board of the Swiss National Bank Michele Bullock, Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia Tiff Macklem, Governor of the Bank of Canada Chang Yong Rhee, Governor of the Bank of Korea Gabriel Galípolo, Governor of the Banco Central do Brasil François Villeroy de Galhau, Chair of the Board of Directors of the Bank for International Settlements Pablo Hernández de Cos, General Manager of the Bank for International Settlements China has threatened to retaliate against Donald Trump for the new 25% tariffs on any countries doing business with Iran. Trump, who is still reviewing a range of military options against the Iranian regime, said the new tariffs would be “effective immediately”, without providing further details about whether there would be any exemptions, including for countries that only trade humanitarian goods such as medicines. More than 140 countries still trade with Iran, according to the World Bank, but sometimes only in minuscule amounts. China though is by far Iran’s biggest trading partner, buying 77% of its oil exports in 2024, according to the data firm Kpler. It has just ended a tariff war with Trump. Liu Pengyu, the spokesperson for the Chinese embassy in Washington, said Beijing would “take all necessary measures” to safeguard its rights and interests. Liu wrote on X: “Tariff wars and trade wars have no winners, and coercion and pressure cannot solve problems. Protectionism harms the interests of all parties.” Other countries that trade heavily with Iran are India, the United Arab Emirates, Japan and South Korea. Japan and South Korea have just completed free trade deals with the US after a bruising confrontation over tariffs. Both countries ended up with a baseline 15% tariff, but now find themselves back in a potential crisis. Good morning and welcome to our US politics live blog. Donald Trump has announced a 25% tariff on any countries doing trade with Iran – which at first glance would appear to apply to China, India, United Arab Emirates and Turkey among others. This is the first concrete action from the US president who on the weekend had said he was considering taking “very strong” military action against Tehran for its deadly crackdown on anti-regime protesters. Yesterday, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said that although diplomacy remained Trump’s “first option”, he was “unafraid to use the lethal force and might of the United States military if and when he deems that necessary”. Elsewhere, central banks around the world have rallied around Fed chairman Jerome Powell, long criticised by Trump for refusing to lower interest rates and now facing federal investigation. The banks have issued a statement in recent hours calling for the independence of the Fed in setting monetary policy to be protected. Trump’s wider policy of imposing tariffs through executive order is under legal pressure as the US supreme court is considering striking down a broad swathe of the president’s existing tariffs. Donald Trump has said “it would be a complete mess” if the US supreme court were to strike them down. In a lengthy post on social media, the US president said “WE’RE SCREWED” if the supreme court rules against the tariffs. The decision is expected as soon as Wednesday. It is a crucial legal test of his controversial economic strategy and his power. Trump said it would be difficult to reverse the tariffs as businesses and countries could claim refunds, saying “it would take many years to figure out what number we are talking about and even, who, when, and where, to pay”. He added: “It would be a complete mess, and almost impossible for our Country to pay.” In November, the supreme court appeared sceptical of the legal basis of the Trump administration’s sweeping global tariff regime when justices questioned the president’s authority to impose the levies. Justices heard oral arguments on the legality of Trump’s tariffs.",

    "title": "Eleven top central bankers defend Fed’s Jerome Powell over DoJ investigation; oil hits two-month high as Trump threatens Iran’s trading partners – business live ",
    "content": "Not everyone agrees that central bank independence is a good thing. Former UK prime minister Liz Truss has criticised the world’s “unaccountable central bankers”, accusing them of being a “complete failure”. Truss (something of an expert on failure herself) writes: We’ve had failing technocrats running monetary policy for the last 25 years and it’s been a complete failure. The era of unaccountable central banks has led to our currency being debased, massive expansion of the state and a crisis in housing affordability. Sovereignty, democracy and accountability needs to be restored. Fact check. Central bankers aren’t, strictly speaking, unaccountable. They are appointed by politicians, who also set their mandates, and are quizzed by the relevent parliamentary body (Jerome Powell, for example, regularly testifies to Congress, while the BoE’s Andrew Bailey appears before the UK’s Treasury Committee several times a year). Central bank independence is generally seen as an improvement on the days when governments set the cost of borrowing (allowing them to engineer a boom before an election, followed by a squeeze afterwards). And the system has generally worked, leading to lower inflation. As Simon French of City firm Panmure Gordon replied to Truss: With respect, in the 28 years prior to BoE independence UK inflation averaged 8.3% YoY, and 2.4.% YoY in the 28 years since. If you missed it yesterday, here’s a video of Jerome Powell revealing that the Department of Justice has served the Federal Reserve with grand jury subpoenas: Significantly, Fed chair Powell insisted this was a political move, saying: This new threat is not about my testimony last June or about the renovation of the Federal Reserve buildings. It is not about Congress’s oversight role; the Fed through testimony and other public disclosures made every effort to keep Congress informed about the renovation project. Those are pretexts. The threat of criminal charges is a consequence of the Federal Reserve setting interest rates based on our best assessment of what will serve the public, rather than following the preferences of the President. Fiona Cincotta, senior market analyst at City Index, says ongoing concerns about Federal Reserve independence have put pressure on the dollar this week. Cincotta explains: The U.S. dollar has come under pressure this week, falling sharply yesterday on reports that the U.S. Department of Justice is considering indicting Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell over a building renovation project at the Federal Reserve headquarters. Powell said he considered the threat a pretext to pressure the Fed to lower interest rates. His comments raised concerns about the Federal Reserve’s independence and exerted downward pressure on the U.S. dollar. The next US inflation report, due at 1.30pm UK time (8.30am EST) today, could also move the dollar, she adds: Attention will now turn to the US CPI report for further clarity over the Fed’s next move. CPI is expected to hold steady at 2.7% in December, while core CPI is expected to rise to 2.7%, up from 2.6%. Given data-collection issues in the November reading, the US CPI for December could come in hotter than expected. The market is currently pricing in two rate cuts from the Fed compared to one rate cut guided by the US central bank. Higher-than-expected inflation could prompt the market to rein in expectations for rate cuts, which would boost the US dollar. Although the US dollar fell yesterday, the news that America’s top central banker was under criminal investigation (a real marmalade dropper) hasn’t caused many serious ructions in the markets. Yet. Dario Perkins, MD for global macro at City consultancy TS Lombard, has warned that the independence of central banks shouldn’t be taken for granted, in an age of populism. Perkins wrote this morning: The short answer is that the market probably won’t react to Trump’s blatant politicization of the Fed until the economy rebounds and/or inflation returns to the top of investors’ minds. There are various scenarios where this stuff just won’t matter. But longer term, we shouldn’t take the independence of central banks for granted. They were a child of post-1990s Neoliberalism – and an obvious target for populists all over the world. Populism and monetary independence don’t mix. Global central banks have issued an extraordinary joint statement offering “full solidarity” to US Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell, in the face of the latest threat to his independence from Donald Trump’s White House. “The independence of central banks is a cornerstone of price, financial and economic stability in the interest of the citizens that we serve. It is therefore critical to preserve that independence, with full respect for the rule of law and democratic accountability,” the statement said. More here. Economists have warned this week that Donald Trump’s attempts to influence the US Federal Reserve could risk plunging America into a period of 1970s-style inflation and trigger a global backlash in financial markets. Analysts drew parallels with the 1970s when US inflation soared after the then president, Richard Nixon, pressured the then Fed chair, Arthur Burns, to ease monetary policy to help smooth his 1972 election campaign. Atakan Bakiskan, US economist at Berenberg bank, said: “If the Fed pursues an ultra-accommodative monetary policy despite higher inflation, the result could resemble the 1970s in a worst-case risk scenario. “Moreover, if the Fed acts on politics rather than data, foreign investors could pull back on financing the US debt and seek new safe havens.” The key worry for central bankers, generally, is that inflation expectations shouldn’t get out of control. That’s why Donald Trump’s criticism of Jerome Powell over many months could be dangerous – investors could conclude that Powell’s successor will be influenced by the whims of the White House, and cut interest rates too much, letting inflation rear out of control. Susannah Streeter, chief investment strategist at Wealth Club, explains: The big worry is that if the Fed is bowed to do the President’s bidding, there will no longer be a razor-sharp focus on ensuring inflation does not veer out of control. Today’s core inflation numbers for December in the US will be under intense scrutiny. There are already signs of persistent inflationary pressure, with the data expected to show a slight tick up in price rises to an annual rate of 2.7% from 2.6% in November, veering further away from target. If it overshoots expectations, it could dampen enthusiasm for equities given that further interest rate cuts could be delayed. But it seems in Trump’s wishful world, the Fed would keep lowering borrowing costs despite runaway inflation risks, which is why there’s so much unease around about US future monetary policy.'’ Newsflash: Eleven of the world’s top central bankers have released a statement of support for Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell, after the US Department of Justice opened a criminal investigation into him. In an unprecedented move, top central bank chiefs including the Bank of England’s Andrew Bailey, and Christine Lagarde of the European Central Bank, have backed Powell, and warned against undermining central bank independence.

This is the second show of support for Powell in two days, after his predecessors at the Fed also backed him: China has criticised Donald Trump’s threat of new 25% tariffs on companies doing business with Iran. Liu Pengyu, the spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in the US, said China’s position against the “indiscriminate imposition of tariffs is consistent and clear”, adding: Tariff wars and trade wars have no winners, and coercion and pressure cannot solve problems. Protectionism harms the interests of all parties. China firmly opposes any illicit unilateral sanctions and long-arm jurisdiction, and will take all necessary measures to safeguard its legitimate rights and interests. Overnight, the United States attorney for the District of Columbia defended her decision to issue the Federal Reserve with subpoenas last week. Jeanine Pirro posted on X that the Fed had ignored previous contact over its renovation project, writing: The United States Attorney’s Office contacted the Federal Reserve on multiple occasions to discuss cost overruns and the chairman’s congressional testimony, but were ignored, necessitating the use of legal process—which is not a threat. The word “indictment” has come out of Mr. Powell’s mouth, no one else’s. None of this would have happened if they had just responded to our outreach. This office makes decisions based on the merits, nothing more and nothing less. We agree with the chairman of the Federal Reserve that no one is above the law, and that is why we expect his full cooperation. Global central bank officials are reportedly planning to release a coordinated statement of support for US Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, after America’s top central banker was threatened with a criminal indictment. Reuters is reporting that the statement, which is expected to contain the signatures of central bankers from around the world, will back Powell and stress the need for independent central banking. It comes after Sunday night’s bombshell news that the US Department of Justice has opened a criminal investigation into Jerome Powell and the Federal Reserve, over renovations to the Fed’s historic office buildings in Washington DC. The move has been widely seen as an attack by the Trump White House on the independence of the Federal Reserve. Yesterday, former Fed chairs Alan Greenspan, Ben Bernanke and Janet Yellen all condemned the “unprecedented” attempt by the Trump administration to weaken the US central bank’s independence, and warned that similar prosecutorial attacks in other countries had led to “highly negative consequences” for the cost of living. Trump has long criticised Powell for not cutting interest rates faster; the danger is that investors conclude that future Fed decisions will be dictated by political considerations, not what’s best for monetary policy. Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey has offered support to Powell in the past; last summer, he called the Fed chair “a man of utmost integrity.” Last April, European Central Bank president Christine Lagarde said she had “enormous respect” for Powell, explaining: “I am reassured by the talent and the competence of the chair of the Fed. And I know for a fact that he’s putting all his efforts and all his discipline into delivering on his mission.” Yesterday, several Republican lawmakers began speaking out against the Trump administration’s criminal investigation into Powell, and Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren warned that Trump’s attempts to control the Federal Reserve “undermines America all around the world”. Warhammer maker Games Workshop is paying out a fresh dividend to investors, after first-half sales and profits rose beyond expectations despite a hit from US tariffs. The Nottingham-based company, which makes tabletop miniatures and games, has enjoyed booming sales, including from video game licensing income, and is building its fourth factory in the UK. It said today it will pay a dividend of £1.10 a share, taking dividends declared so far in 2025/26 to £4.85 a share. Set up five decades ago by three school friends in Shepherd’s Bush, Games Workshop has grown into a FTSE 100 company worth more than £6bn. It had said tariffs imposed by Donald Trump last spring could impact profit before tax by £12m in 2025/26. It incurred £6m due to the tariffs in the six months to 30 November, but the impact on its gross profit margin has been more than offset by efficiencies, price rises of 3.5% on its fantasy miniature figures and books, more stable commodity prices and lower stock write offs. Core revenues, excluding licensing, rose by 17% to £316.1m and total sales were £334.7m at constant currency, up 11%. Profit before tax climbed by 11% to £140.8m, better than expected. The company, which has 570 stores, including 134 in the UK, 201 in North America and 167 in continental Europe, said it would open a cafe Warhammer World store on the US east coast in 2027. It makes all of its miniatures in the UK, and plans another warehouse in the UK. Games Workshop is working with Amazon MGM Studios, actor Henry Cavill and production company Vertigo on live action projects, which will take several years. It signed up with Amazon just over a year ago to adapt its Warhammer 40,000 brand into films and television series, and work is almost complete on a Warhammer Age of Sigmar episode for its Prime Video. Even so, Games Workshop’s shares fell by over 3% this morning – but are up 38.5% over the past year. The EU has warned Elon Musk’s X to urgently “fix” the “horrendous” AI tool allowing users to “undress” women and children or face urgent action. The blunt warning comes as the European Commission extended a retention order sent to Elon Musk’s X last year to retain and preserve all internal documents and data related to xAI chatbot Grok until the end of 2026, amid a global outcry over Grok-generated “undressed” images. The EU tech commissioner Henna Virkunnen said last night: “X now has to fix its AI tool in the EU, and they have to do it quickly. “If not, we will not hesitate to put the DSA to its full use to protect EU citizens” “X offering the use of Grok to create and share pictures of undressed women and children is horrendous,” she added in a post on X. Governments and regulators from Europe to Asia are cracking down on sexually explicit content generated by Grok on X, launching probes, imposing bans and demanding safeguards, in a growing global push to curb illegal material. The British prime minister has warned that X could lose its right to self regulate if Musk’s platform keeps creating sexual images. Malaysia’s communications regulator said on Tuesday it will take legal action against social media platform X due to concerns over user safety in relation to Grok. UK minicomputer-maker Raspberry Pi is suffering from the AI industry’s rapacious appetite for memory chips. Raspberry Pi told shareholders this morning that volatility in the supply and price of memory was clouding its outlook beyond the first half of this year. It says: As has been widely reported, the cost of the LPDDR4 DRAM used in many Raspberry Pi products has increased rapidly in recent months, with some major suppliers now indicating limitations of supply at high densities. This trend has largely been driven by memory vendors diverting manufacturing capacity to meet the surge in AI data centre investment. Raspberry Pi is taking steps to mitigate this problem, including approving new suppliers, developing products that use less memory, and raising its prices. Shares in the Cambridge-based company have dropped by over 6% this morning, the worst performer on the FTSE 250 index. From oil to wind power…. and shares of Danish renewables giant Orsted have jumped over 5% this morning, after a US judge gave it clearance to resume work on a project off the coast of Rhode Island. The ruling by US district judge Royce Lamberth is a legal setback for Trump, who has sought to block expansion of offshore wind in federal waters. It means Orsted can complete its nearly finished Revolution Wind project, which could begin generating power this year. In the City, hotel operator Whitbread has jumped to the top of the FTSE 100’s top risers table this morning, after predicting a smaller hit from UK property taxes. Whitbread told shareholders this morning that it now expects business rate hikes announced in the autumn budget to cost it around £35m in the next financial year. That’s an improvement on its previous estimate, that the budget would cost it between £40m and £50m. Whitbread’s shares are up 4% this morning. Mamta Valechha, consumer discretionary analyst at Quilter Cheviot: “Whitbread, owner of Premier Inn, posited a solid trading update this morning. Its UK revenue per available room (RevPAR) came in better than expected with an increase of 2.5% in Q3 and showing another sequential improvement quarter-on-quarter. The company’s current trading remains strong, with RevPAR accelerating to 4% in the first six weeks of Q4. This was driven predominantly by London where it grew 7% and Regions up 0.9%, with pricing having the biggest impact in both areas. Automobile manufacturer Volkswagen has reported that its sales in the US fell last year, due to Donald Trump’s tariffs. In 2025, Volkswagen’s global sales fell by 1.4%, which it blames on “challenging market conditions”. Volkswagen grew its sales in Europe by 5.1%, and by 18.5% in South America. But sales fell by 8.2% in the US, with VW warning that “US tariffs also had a marked impact on deliveries in North America”. Demand also weakened in China, where VW’s sales fell 8.4%. Martin Sander, Volkswagen board member for sales, marketing and after sales, says: “The trend in our delivery figures underscores that our products are being well received by our customers and also that we are on the right track with our brand strategy. We expect the market environment to remain challenging overall in 2026. All the same, I firmly believe that thanks to our refreshed, attractive product portfolio and our clear focus on efficiency and competitiveness we are very well equipped to rise to this challenge. In China alone, we will be bringing out more than ten new electric models this year.” US crude oil is also climbing this morning. US West Texas Intermediate crude rose to $60/barrel this morning, for the first time in over a month. ING commodities strategists said today: “The price increase comes amid intensifying protests in Iran, raising the possibility of some form of intervention by the U.S.” Speaking of tariffs…. Donald Trump has also claimed that the US would be “screwed” if the supreme court does not uphold his trade levies. In a post last night, Trump claimed the US would have to repay “many Hundreds of Billions of Dollars” if the US highest court rules against the White House, plus the “payback” which companies building factories in America to avoid tariffs would – he argues - demand. Trump wrote: When these Investments are added, we are talking about Trillions of Dollars! It would be a complete mess, and almost impossible for our Country to pay. Anybody who says that it can be quickly and easily done would be making a false, inaccurate, or totally misunderstood answer to this very large and complex question. In a dramatic twist, Trump concluded: Remember, when America shines brightly, the World shines brightly. In other words, if the Supreme Court rules against the United States of America on this National Security bonanza, WE’RE SCREWED! [Reminder: tariffs are paid by US companies when they import goods] The Supreme Court could rule as soon as tomorrow on Trump’s tariffs. Last November, they expressed some scepticism of the legal basis of the Trump administration’s sweeping global tariff regime, pointing out that Congress is in charge of taxes. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets and the world economy. Oil has hit its highest level in almost two months this morning, after Donald Trump theatened new tariffs on any country doing business with Iran. In a post on Truth Social on Monday, the US president declared: Effective immediately, any Country doing business with the Islamic Republic of Iran will pay a Tariff of 25% on any and all business being done with the United States of America. This Order is final and conclusive. Thank you for your attention to this matter! Top export destinations for Iranian goods include China, the United Arab Emirates and India, so this could reignite Trump’s smouldering trade war. The threat came as Iranian auhorities crack down on nationwide protests; as of this morning, at least 648 people have been killed by Iran’s security services and more than 10,600 have been arrested. Iran is one of the biggest producers of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, so any escalation could disrupt oil supply or add a geopolitical risk premium. Brent crude has climbed to $64.46 a barrel this morning, its highest level since 19 November. A week ago Brent fell below $60/barrel, when investors were pondering the prospect of increased crude supply from Venezuela. Analysts at Barclays have calculated that the unrest in Iran has added about $3-4/barrel in geopolitical risk premium in oil prices.

    "title": "Wes Streeting criticises Labour colleagues who blame Whitehall for blocking reform – UK politics live",
    "content": "Davey says that President Trump’s comments about Greenland show that he is “out of control”. He says Keir Starmer and other European leaders were right to issue a statement saying that the future of Greenland is not a matter for the US. And he says he would be happy to see Nato come up with a strong response, putting Nato forces there to protect it from Russia. And the US should be invited to join that mission, he says. The press conference is now over. Q: Would you support a total ban on under-16s having social media accounts? Davey says, as a parent, he thinks we have to have this debate. He thinks there has to be “some sort of ban”. There’s no doubt that we’re going to have to put some sort of ban in place to keep them safe. So no doubt about that. The question is, how do you do that? I’ve seen some of the proposals from other parties. There’s a danger that they will have some unintended consequences. So I’m really worried that the idea we’ve heard from the Conservatives is that GCSE pupils will end up being banned from Wikipedia. Davey says Tony Blair and New Labour were right to say that A&amp;E waits should be reduced to a maximum of four hours. By and large they achieved that. The fact that that is no longer the case shows how far backwards the NHS went under the Tories, he says. Q: Why are you doing so badly in Wales? Davey says the Lib Dems won a seat again in Wales at the last election. And he says he thinks they will improve their representation in the Senedd at the elections this year. He won’t go beyond that, he says. He says, with Plaid Cymru, Wales has real multi-party politics. Asked about assisted dying, Davey says he voted against the bill. But he goes on: I personally voted against the assisted dying bill. And, though many of my colleagues didn’t, I think the real issue at the moment is what the Lords is doing, and I think it’s quite outrageous that that seems to be members of the House of Lords who are trying to kill the bill. And I say that as an opponent of the bill. But it’s the democratic right of the House of Commons to pass bad law if it wants to. Q: Before the election you said the problem with the NHS was Tory incompetence. Now you say it is Labour incompetence. Do you have a view as to what the underlying problem is? Davey says he is clear that the Tories are most to claim for the NHS crisis. But he says Labour has not been able to sort the problem out. He says the Lib Dem argument that is that social care must be transformed at the same time. That is what experts think, he says. And sorting out care would transformative. He says he set out this argument in his book last year, Why I Care. The Guardian wrote an editorial about this at the time. Q: What is your approach to Labour? And, with all the challenges facing the Lib Dems this year, are you the person to carry on leading them? Davey says Labour have been a disappointment. And he says they are the party with a leadership problem; there are Labour MPs who want Wes Streeting to be leader. But Streeting needs to sort out the trolley wait problem first, he says. Referring to the Lib Dems, he says the YouGov poll today shows that are five parties within 10 points of each other. But the Lib Dems are doing well in actual elections, he says. He says in May last year the Lib Dems beat Labour and the Conservatives for the first time. Davey says he had hoped that Keir Starmer was serious about what he said during the election campaign about wanting a cross-party solution to social care. He goes on: I’m afraid I’ve been proved wrong. There has been total failure on social care, kicking it into the long grass. No real political push for it. Elongated timetables. So they’ve been huge, disappointing. And they will not save our NHS unless they sort out care. I’ve long said if you if you care about the NHS, you’ve got to care about care. On Iran, Davey says he would take Donald Trump’s comments about stopping the murder of protesters more seriously if he were also willing to stop things like that happening in Minnesota. But he says he supports Trump in wanting to use sanctions to put pressure on Iran. Q: What you are proposing would cost less than 1% of the NHS budget. Is this really about changing the NHS, or is it really about campaigning ahead of the local elections? Davey says this is about responding to “the pain and distress that people are feeling in every hospital A&amp;E across the country”, and showing that there is a political party that wants to do something about it. Responding to the claim that £1.5bn is not a big enough sum, he says this shows that the plan is affordable. And he rejects the suggestion he is parking Lib Dems tanks on Labour’s lawn. The NHS was a liberal creation, he says, citing William Beveridge. Davey urges journalist at the press conference to visit hospitals themselves and examine what is happening in A&amp;E. It is really quite astonishing. It’s never happened before in my lifetime. And it’s the untold crisis in the health service. Q: Why are the Liberal Democrats still using X? Davey says he is not afraid to pick a fight with Elon Musk. He says Musk has interfered in British democracy “in the most outrageous way”. Musk has also incited violence, he says. And he says what has been happening with Grok has been “shocking”. But he says there should be a “strong liberal voice” on social media. UPDATE: Davey said: I’ve picked a few fights with Elon Musk because I think he has interfered in British democracy in the most outrageous way. He’s incited violence and I have called in the past for investigations into him. The point about Grok – which is quite shocking – and what it is doing, and the danger that it poses to women in the UK, to our children, is quite shocking. We need to take it really seriously. We have been thinking about it really hard. There’s a real balance to strike here. I think X does need a strong Liberal voice and I’m leader of the Liberal Democrats to give that voice. When it was put to him that, without the US pharmaceutical deal agreed before Christmas, companies would no longer invest in life-saving treatments, Davey said he did not accept that. He said that the claims from the Trump administration were wrong, and that the UK government was being “weak”. At his press conference Ed Davey is now taking questions. Asked if just getting rid of 12-hour waits was not very ambitious, Davey said over time he would like to go further. He would like to get back to the era when no one had to wait more than four hours. He also claimed the Lib Dems were the only party talking about this. In his speech Davey also criticised Labour over the lack of jobs availabe for doctors after they train. The Department of Health and Social Care has announced a plan to help with this problem today. PA Media reports: Medical graduates from the UK and Ireland will be prioritised for training places under new legislation to be proposed by the government. The move forms part of the health secretary’s aim of resolving the dispute between the government and resident doctors in England. Wes Streeting said that while the NHS “will never exclude international talent” he wants to give “home-grown medics” the “level playing field they deserve”. He met representatives from the British Medical Association (BMA) last week with a view to ending strike action by doctors. The medical training (prioritisation) bill will be introduced to parliament today. The proposed legislation will prioritise doctors from the UK and Ireland, and those who have worked in the NHS for a significant period, for specialty training places. Specialty training is the final stage of becoming a fully qualified doctor, with a focus on a specialist area of medicine or general practice. Graduates from the UK and Ireland would also be prioritised for foundation training under the bill. Since 2019, the number of applicants for training posts has risen from 12,000 to almost 40,000, the Department of Health and Social Care said. In his speech this morning Ed Davey criticised the record of the other main parties on the NHS. He is particularly harsh about Reform UK and Nigel Farage, the Reform leader. [Farage] still hasn’t mentioned it once in the House of Commons, although he’s not actually there often, so that might be why. But he hasn’t said the word hospitals once. But we know what he wants to do, don’t we? We know what his plan is, even if he’s now too smart to say it out loud. He wants to privatise the NHS, replace it with an American style insurance system, a system where every year in the US, almost half a million people go bankrupt because of their medical bills. That is Trump’s America. Don’t let it become Farage’s Britain. Ed Davey, the Lib Dem leader, has set out a plan to end 12-hour A&amp;E waits in English hospital. The party says the problem has escalated hugely over the past few years, and it is proposing two measures that it says would address the problem. They are: “A new law to enshrine the right for patients to be seen in A&amp;E within 12 hours.” “Spending £1.5bn to make around 6,000 more beds available each day by expanding hospital capacity and creating ‘safety net’ social care beds for patients waiting on long-term care decisions.” The Lib Dems would get the money by “cancelling the planned medicine price hike agreed with the Trump administration before Christmas”. Speaking at a news conference this morning, Davey said: Right now, in the corridors of A&amp;E departments across our country, there are thousands of people – sick or injured – lying on trolleys or waiting on plastic chairs. No privacy. No dignity. There have even been tragic cases of people dying on those trolleys and left undiscovered for hours. What more stark an example could there be, of the way things in our country aren’t working the way they should, than thousands of people lying for hours in corridors in our hospitals, and people dying on those trolleys? This deadly corridor crisis isn’t befitting of the heroic doctors, nurses and other health professionals who work in our NHS. It’s not what we expect from our NHS, and it’s not what we pay our hard-earned money in taxes to fund our NHS for … With the package we are calling for today, the government could put an end to 12-hour A&amp;E waits altogether, by the end of the year. Never again should anyone have to watch their loved one die on a trolley in a hospital corridor. The Lib Dems also released this chart showing how the number of 12-hour trolley waits has soared. Here is Jessica Elgot’s report on Wes Streeting’s speech. (See 9.45am.) Here is a fuller version of the quote from Wes Streeting’s speech, from the Times’ Steven Swinford. Bafflingly, some on my own side of the political divide have begun to parrot the same argument. They complain about the civil service. They blame stakeholder capture. This excuses culture does the centre-left no favours. If we tell the public that we can’t make anything work, then why on earth would they vote to keep us in charge? And we should be in no doubt that they are excuses. Back to my shopping trolley analogy: there’s no point complaining about the wonky wheel if you’re letting the trolley have a mind of its own, instead of steering it towards the destination you’re after. Wes Streeting, the health secretary, has given a speech to the Institute for Government conference this morning. As Jessica Elgot reports, Streeting criticised politicians who complain about being unable to reform public services because of Whitehall inertia. New - Streeting goes full throttle on the idea that politicians can’t make the state work and that “nothing happens” when levers are pulled. “Where there aren’t levers, we build them. Where there are barriers, we bulldoze them. Where there is poor performance, we challenge it.” He says the complaints are just poor excuses from the right. “Bafflingly, some on my own side of the political divide have begun to parrot the same argument... If we tell the public that we can’t make anything work, then why on earth would they vote to keep us in charge?” This was aimed partly at the right. (At the Reform UK press conference yesterday, the party’s latest recruit Nadhim Zahawi was complaining about the “over-mighty bureaucratic inertia that now dominates and runs the country”, for which he claimed Tony Blair was mostly to blame”.) But Streeting criticised Labour figures who adopt this view too. He may have been thinking of the former adviser to Keir Starmer, Paul Ovenden, who wrote an article for the Times over the holiday period complaining about the “supremacy of the stakeholder state”. But Starmer has also himself set out this argument – in December 2024, when he said that there were “too many people in Whitehall are comfortable in the tepid bath of managed decline”, and again last month, when he said: My experience now as prime minister is of frustration that every time I go to pull a lever there are a whole bunch of regulations, consultations, arm’s-length bodies that mean that the action from pulling the lever to delivery is longer than I think it ought to be, which is among the reasons why I want to cut down on regulation, generally and within government. Streeting’s comment will be seen by some as an implicit dig at Starmer – although he might argue that he was just restating the determination to make the Whitehall machine deliver that the PM himself has also set out. Good morning. British politics in 2026 has to a large extent been preoccupied with foreign affairs, and Donald Trump’s turbocharged neo-imperialism, but domestic problems remain paramount. At the PLP last night, as Pippa Crerar reports, Keir Starmer sought to justify the amount of time he spends on foreign policy by saying it has a direct link to cost of living problems. And, with immigration and small boats a key issue for voters, the Home Office is today talking up its record on one aspect of this problem. Shabana Mahmood, the home secretary, has released figures which, she says, shows that raids to catch people working in the UK illegally have reached “the highest level in British history”. The PA Media write-up is a tad less hyperbolic, saying the figures are at their highest level “since current records began in 2019”. PA reports: Some 12,791 visits took place in 2025, up 57% from 8,122 in the previous year, to businesses such as nail bars, car washes, barbers and takeaway shops. Ministers are seeking to crack down on illegal working in the UK, as part of efforts to deter those coming to the country illegally. Meanwhile, arrests were also at a record high of 8,971 last year, up nearly 59% compared to 5,647 in 2024 – the previous highest point in data published by the Home Office. Of those arrested, 1,087 people have been removed from the UK so far … The Home Office also said visits were up 77% and arrests were up 83% since Labour came to power. Some 17,483 visits and 12,322 arrests were recorded between July 2024 and December last year, up from 9,894 and 6,725 respectively across January 2023 to June 2024. Of the arrests, 1,726 people have been returned so far, up 35% on the 1,283 removed from visits in the previous 18-month period. In a related move, the Home Office is opening a Secure Borders UK TikTok account designed to discourage people from coming to the UK illegally on small boats. The Sun has got some examples of the video if will feature (mostly people being detained, it appears), and its write-up is negative and sarcastic. The headline, “Fury as ‘pathetic’ PM’s ‘laughable’ brainwave to stop Channel migrant dinghies is revealed to be a new TIKTOK ACCOUNT”, sets the tone. But public opinion does not get turned around overnight, and in Labour circles there may be a tiny bit of cheer this morning from the latest YouGov poll for the Times and Sky News showing Reform UK support at its lowest level since April. There is plenty more domestic politics to come as the day goes on. Here is the agenda for the day. 8.30am: Wes Streeting, the health secretary, speaks at the Institute for Government’s annual conference. Other speakers during the day include: Louise Casey, chair of the independent commission into adult social case, at 9.40am; Andy Burnham, the mayor of Greater Manchester, and Michael Gove, the former Tory cabinet minister, at 11.45am; Darren Jones, the chief secretary to the PM, at 2.45pm; and Mel Stride, the shadow chancellor, at 4.30pm. 9.30am: Keir Starmer chairs cabinet. There is a political cabinet, and a normal cabinet. 9.30am: Rhun ap Iorwerth, the Plaid Cymru leader, holds a press conference in Cardiff 10am: Ed Davey, the Lib Dem leader, holds a press conference to promote a plan to end 12-hour A&amp;E waits. Later he will visit London Air Ambulance. 11am: Starmer hosts Karol Nawrocki, the Polish president, in No 10. 11.30am: Streeting takes questions in the Commons. Noon: Downing Street holds a lobby briefing. 2.20pm: Shona Robison, the Scottish government’s finance secretary, presents her budget to MSPs. 2.30pm: Kirsty Brimelow, chair of the Bar Council, and other senior legal figures give evidence to the Commons justice committee about plans to restric jury trials; at 3.30pm Sarah Sackman, a justice minister, gives evidence. If you want to contact me, please post a message below the line when comments are open (between 10am and 3pm), or message me on social media. I can’t read all the messages BTL, but if you put “Andrew” in a message aimed at me, I am more likely to see it because I search for posts containing that word. If you want to flag something up urgently, it is best to use social media. You can reach me on Bluesky at @andrewsparrowgdn.bsky.social. The Guardian has given up posting from its official accounts on X, but individual Guardian journalists are there, I still have my account, and if you message me there at @AndrewSparrow, I will see it and respond if necessary. I find it very helpful when readers point out mistakes, even minor typos. No error is too small to correct. And I find your questions very interesting too. I can’t promise to reply to them all, but I will try to reply to as many as I can, either BTL or sometimes in the blog.",

    "title": "Australian author Craig Silvey charged with possessing and distributing child exploitation material",
    "content": "Prominent Australian author Craig Silvey has been charged with possessing and distributing child exploitation material. Silvey, 43, had a search warrant issued at his Fremantle home on Monday, 12 January, where detectives allegedly found him “actively engaging with other child exploitation offenders online”. “He was immediately arrested, and his electronic devices were seized,” a Western Australia police spokesperson said. He appeared before the Fremantle magistrates court on Tuesday, 13 January, charged with distribution of child exploitation material and possession of child exploitation material. No pleas were entered and Silvey was granted bail with conditions, and a $100,000 personal undertaking and a $100,000 surety. In WA, child exploitation material refers to any material, including images, videos, writings, or data, that depicts or describes a person who is under 16 in a sexual context or being subjected to abuse or cruelty. Sign up: AU Breaking News email Silvey is an award-winning writer best known for his coming-of-age works Jasper Jones and Runt, which have both been adapted into feature films and garnered critical acclaim. He has twice been named one of the Sydney Morning Herald’s best young Australian novelists and is a patron of the City of Subiaco’s Craig Silvey Award for Young Writers. The Western Australian began his career as a young adult author, with his works featuring prominently in Australian education. Both Jasper Jones and his award-winning book Honeybee are frequently included in school curricula and national reading lists. He grew up on his parents’ apple orchard outside Dwellingup, a rural town south of Perth, before moving to Fremantle at 17 where he wrote his debut novel, Rhubarb. The WA police spokesperson said the investigation was ongoing and urged anyone with information to contact police. Silvey’s publisher, Allen &amp; Unwin, said on Tuesday night that it was aware of the “deeply distressing” charges and would pause promotional activity of his work while the legal process took its course. Silvey was scheduled to appear in court again on 10 February. - with AAP",

    "title": "Wes Streeting attacks centre-left for ‘excuses culture’ of blaming civil service ",
    "content": "Wes Streeting has criticised the centre-left of politics for an “excuses culture” which blames Whitehall and stakeholders for the slow pace of change, saying politicians “are not simply at the mercy of forces outside of our control”. Speaking at the Institute for Government (IFG), the health secretary’s comments will be seen as an attack on complaints by allies of Keir Starmer that change has been constantly delayed by the number of regulations and arm’s-length bodies. One of the prime minister’s former key aides Paul Ovenden authored a piece earlier this month about the power of a “stakeholder state”. He said campaign groups, regulators, litigators, trade bodies and well-networked organisations were hobbling any change the government wanted to pursue. Starmer himself has voiced frustration that “levers” that he could pull as prime minister often resulted in obstruction. At the same conference, Streeting’s comments were echoed by Louise Casey, the lead non-executive director in Whitehall, who said the government needed to “just stop” complaining it was difficult to get things done. However, she also highlighted a “sense of learned helplessness and hopelessness” within the civil service and an “intransigence” in the face of change. In his remarks, Streeting said he was angered to see his own side making similar comments to the hard right about public services’ inability to change. He said: “The right encourage this argument. They are rolling the pitch to come in with a chainsaw and tear up public services entirely. “Bafflingly, some on my own side of the political divide have begun to parrot the same argument. They complain about the civil service. They blame stakeholder capture. “This excuses culture does the centre-left no favours. If we tell the public that we can’t make anything work, then why on earth would they vote to keep us in charge?” Streeting likened the state to a shopping trolley with a “wonky wheel” which is primed towards the status quo. But he said that was no excuse for poor steering. “We should be in no doubt that they are excuses… There’s no point complaining about the wonky wheel if you’re letting the trolley have a mind of its own, instead of steering it towards the destination you’re after. “We are not simply at the mercy of forces outside of our control. Our fortunes are in our hands. And it is precisely because we on centre-left believe in the power of the state to transform people’s lives, that we are best placed to change it.” Streeting said politicians should be getting on with fixing the issues without delay. “Where there aren’t levers, we build them. Where there are barriers, we bulldoze them. Where there is poor performance, we challenge it,” he said. He said that reform of public services was “one of the greatest challenges of our age … Failure in this area has led to disaffection, cynicism, and ultimately the rise of populists.” But he said it was also urgent because of surging demand for health and care services, including people managing multiple conditions, failures in prevention and demand for mental health and special needs services. And he said people were paying more and more but getting “a poorer service in return”. “They rightly ask: if I can track a parcel across the world, why can’t the state tell me what’s happening with my case? Why do I have to tell my story five times? Why do I have to travel, queue, wait and chase? Unless the state modernises it will become increasingly irrelevant to the lives of its citizens. “Failure to address these challenges is creating a national mood of cynicism and pessimism. But the most corrosive sense of all is fatalism: the idea that things can’t change.” Starmer had told the liaison committee of MPs before Christmas of his own frustrations with the delays built into the functioning of government. “My experience now as prime minister is of frustration that every time I go to pull a lever there are a whole bunch of regulations, consultations, arm’s-length bodies that mean that the action from pulling the lever to delivery is longer than I think it ought to be, which is among the reasons why I want to cut down on regulation, generally and within government,” he told the committee. Also speaking at the IFG conference, the Labour peer and former adviser Ayesha Hazarika said there was not a “good enough sense of team” between ministers and civil servants any more. She also said it was “very easy to blame civil servants and the state and say that it’s not easy to get things done” but the story had to be communicated about what was being achieved. Ipsos polling released at the event showed that the public are giving the Labour government low marks for its performance in running the country over 2025 – a score of just 3.6 out of 10 on average. Among 2024 Labour voters it was just five out of 10. Almost two-thirds of the public (63%) said they were disappointed with the Labour party’s performance to date, a score which has risen from 56% nearly a year ago. The polling also showed that the public’s lead priority for 2026 is dealing with the cost of living and inflation, followed by healthcare and immigration.",

    "title": "Guinness and Johnnie Walker owner Diageo ‘could sell Chinese assets’",
    "content": "Diageo’s new boss, Dave Lewis, has barely started in the role, and the maker of Guinness and Johnnie Walker is already reportedly considering selling off its Chinese assets to trim down its portfolio. The world’s largest spirits maker, whose other brands include Smirnoff vodka, Captain Morgan rum and Don Julio tequila, is working with Goldman Sachs and UBS to review its operations in China, where sales have been falling, according to Bloomberg News. Diageo’s assets in the country include a 63%-plus stake in Shanghai-listed Sichuan Swellfun, which distributes the distilled spirit Baiju. The banks have been sounding out initial interest from Chinese strategic buyers and private equity. Shares in Sichuan Swellfun have dropped 14% in the past year, giving the Chengdu-based company a market value of 19.2bn yuan (£2bn). Lewis, a former Tesco chief executive who took the reins at Diageo on 1 January, was known as “Drastic Dave” during his nearly three decades at the Marmite to Dove soap conglomerate Unilever for his cost-cutting. He then revived Tesco, Britain’s biggest supermarket chain, after a damaging accounting scandal, slimmed down its international arm, closed unprofitable divisions such as electricals and slashed thousands of jobs. London-based Diageo is struggling with the impact of Donald Trump’s tariffs, high debt levels and consumer shifts, as many younger people choose to drink little or no alcohol. In November, it flagged a double-digit sales decline in China. Diageo is streamlining its portfolio after announcing the sale of its 65% stake in East African Breweries for $2.3bn (£1.7bn) to Japan’s Asahi Group last month, offloading its last direct African beer operation. Lewis took over from Debra Crew, a former captain in US military intelligence, who was appointed as chief executive in 2023 after the untimely death of the highly regarded Ivan Menezes. Her tenure was marked by a shock profits warning later that year caused by supply issues in Latin America, as cash-strapped customers in Latin America and the Caribbean were consuming less alcohol and seeking cheaper brands. There were further supply problems in the run-up to Christmas last year – this time a shortage of Guinness, when UK pubs complained that their flow of the “black stuff” had been rationed. Diageo declined to comment.",

    "title": "MP’s visit to school cancelled after opposition from pro-Palestine group",
    "content": "A planned visit by a Jewish Labour MP who is a vice-chair of Labour Friends of Israel was cancelled after a campaign by a pro-Palestine group, it has emerged. Damien Egan, the Labour MP for Bristol North East, had been booked to speak to students at Bristol Brunel academy, but the visit was called off by the school hours before it was due to happen. The cancellation took place in September but has been highlighted now after the communities secretary, Steve Reed, said a Jewish colleague was banned from visiting a school in his constituency amid concerns his presence would “inflame” teachers. Speaking at a Jewish Labour Movement conference in north London on Sunday, he said: “I have a colleague who is Jewish, who has been banned from visiting a school and refused permission to visit a school in his own constituency, in case his presence inflames the teachers. That is an absolute outrage.” Reed added: “They will be called in, and they will be held to account for doing that, because you cannot have people with those kinds of attitudes teaching our children.” He did not name the colleague but sources close to Egan have confirmed to the Guardian that Reed was talking about the Bristol MP’s planned visit in September. It is understood there is still hope the visit may eventually go ahead. After the visit was called off, Bristol Palestine Solidarity Campaign wrote on Facebook: “The planned school visit by Damien Egan, MP for Bristol North East, has been cancelled after concerns were raised by the NEU [National Education Union] staff group, parents and local constituents. “This is a clear message: politicians who openly support Israel’s genocidal assault on Gaza are not welcome in our schools. Egan is vice-chair of Labour Friends of Israel and has visited Israel since the current onslaught on Gaza began, demonstrating his support.” On its Facebook page, Bristol NEU wrote: “We celebrate this cancellation as a win for safeguarding, solidarity, and for the power of the NEU trade union staff group, parents, and campaigners standing together.” Reed said at the conference the UK government had been slow to respond to some examples of anti-Israel extremism, and promised Labour had “reassessed” this approach. Since winning his seat at the last election, Egan has been targeted by anti-Israel activists. He has an Israeli husband, the software developer Yossi Felberbaum. The investigative newsroom the Bristol Cable reported the cancellation in November when an NEU member at another Bristol school described a “flurry of organising” including a plan for people to wear keffiyehs for the day of the visit. Egan has not commented. Bristol Brunel academy said the visit was postponed after it heard of plans for a protest to take place. A spokesperson said: “Mr Egan was due to discuss democracy and the role of an MP, while helping to raise aspirations among students who may have an interest in pursuing similar career paths. “On the evening before Mr Egan’s scheduled visit, we were made aware of plans for a public protest outside the school. We opted to postpone Mr Egan’s visit to ensure everyone would continue to feel safe when entering and exiting school and to prevent any disruption to our students’ learning. “We have remained in contact with Mr Egan, and an alternative date for his visit was arranged some time ago. We have also been in contact with the police and followed their advice.” Egan is a former student of Cabot Learning Federation, the multi-academy trust of which Bristol Brunel is part. • The headline of this article was amended on 13 January 2026 to better reflect the article’s text.",
