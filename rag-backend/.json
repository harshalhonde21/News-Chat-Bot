  "answer": "Here's the latest news about technology based on the provided sources:\n\n*   Governments and regulators from Europe to Asia are cracking down on sexually explicit content generated by Elon Musk’s xAI chatbot Grok on X, launching probes, imposing bans, and demanding safeguards. Malaysia’s communications regulator announced it will take legal action against X due to concerns over user safety regarding Grok (Source 2, Source 3).\n*   The EU has warned Elon Musk’s X to urgently \"fix\" its AI tool allowing users to \"undress\" women and children or face urgent action, and has extended a retention order for internal documents and data related to Grok until the end of 2026. EU tech commissioner Henna Virkunnen stated that X must fix its AI tool quickly or face the full use of the DSA (Source 3).\n*   The British prime minister has warned that X could lose its right to self-regulate if the platform continues to create sexual images (Source 3).\n*   UK minicomputer-maker Raspberry Pi is experiencing difficulties due to the AI industry's high demand for memory chips, leading to volatility in supply and price of LPDDR4 DRAM. The company is taking steps to mitigate this, including approving new suppliers, developing products with less memory, and raising prices (Source 3).\n*   Mobile phones in Iran were able to make international calls on Tuesday morning, although internet restrictions reportedly remain in place (Source 1).",
